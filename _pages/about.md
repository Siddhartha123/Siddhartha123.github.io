#### Hey Voila! :wave:

I'm currently a Digital Design Engineer at Texas Instruments in Bangalore.

My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (Multi-modal Learning). Currently, I'm focusing on the challenge of Multimodal Video Summarization on Long-form Videos. Besides, we're also working on Emotion Recognition and Tracking from Video, Text, and Audio.

Before I joined TI, I completed my Masters at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in) (2019-22) where I worked with Prof. Sachin Patkar. For my M.Tech thesis, I worked on developing Hardware accelerator architectures for Post-Quantum Cryptography (More on that here). I also worked with Prof. Biswa on Randmoized cache security (more details here). I graduated with B.Tech degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [National Institute of Technology, Rourkela](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in) in 2019.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading about recent trends in tech and I also enjoy gardening.
